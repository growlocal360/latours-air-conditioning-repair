          <p class="lead">Your home's ductwork is the respiratory system of your HVAC—and over time, it accumulates dust, allergens, mold, and debris that get circulated throughout your home every time the system runs. Professional <strong>duct cleaning</strong> removes these contaminants, improving air quality and helping your HVAC system operate more efficiently.</p>

          <p>In Louisiana's humid climate, ductwork is particularly susceptible to mold and mildew growth. If you've noticed musty odors, excessive dust, or worsening allergy symptoms, dirty ducts may be the culprit.</p>

          <h2>Our Duct Cleaning Process</h2>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Inspection:</strong> We inspect your ductwork to assess conditions and identify any problems</li>
            <li><strong>Protection:</strong> We protect your floors, furniture, and belongings</li>
            <li><strong>Source Removal:</strong> Using powerful vacuum equipment, we remove debris from your entire duct system</li>
            <li><strong>Brush & Agitate:</strong> We use rotating brushes to dislodge stubborn buildup</li>
            <li><strong>Sanitize (Optional):</strong> Anti-microbial treatment to kill mold and bacteria</li>
            <li><strong>Final Inspection:</strong> We verify all ducts are clean and check for any repairs needed</li>
          </ol>

          <h2>Signs Your Ducts Need Cleaning</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Visible dust around vents:</strong> Dust buildup on registers indicates dirty ducts</li>
            <li><strong>Musty or stale odors:</strong> Often indicates mold growth in ductwork</li>
            <li><strong>Allergy symptoms at home:</strong> Dirty ducts circulate allergens throughout your home</li>
            <li><strong>Excessive dust on surfaces:</strong> If you're dusting constantly, dirty ducts may be the source</li>
            <li><strong>Visible mold:</strong> Any visible mold around vents or in ducts requires immediate attention</li>
            <li><strong>Recent construction or renovation:</strong> Construction dust settles in ductwork</li>
            <li><strong>New home purchase:</strong> You don't know when ducts were last cleaned</li>
            <li><strong>Pest evidence:</strong> Signs of rodents or insects in your ductwork</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>When to Consider Duct Cleaning</h2>
          <p>The EPA recommends duct cleaning when:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>There is visible mold growth inside ducts or on other HVAC components</li>
            <li>Ducts are infested with vermin (rodents or insects)</li>
            <li>Ducts are clogged with excessive dust and debris</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Additionally, consider duct cleaning if:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>It's been 5+ years since your last cleaning</li>
            <li>You've completed a home renovation</li>
            <li>You've just moved into a new home</li>
            <li>Someone in your household has allergies or asthma</li>
            <li>You have pets that shed</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Dryer Vent Cleaning</h2>
          <p>We also offer dryer vent cleaning, which is important for both efficiency and safety. Clogged dryer vents are a leading cause of house fires and make your dryer work harder, using more energy.</p>
