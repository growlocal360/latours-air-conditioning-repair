          <p class="lead">The <strong>Charpentier Historic District</strong> is home to some of Lake Charles' most beautiful Victorian and Craftsman architecture. At Latour's HVAC, we understand that these treasured homes require special consideration when it comes to <strong>air conditioning repair</strong> and HVAC installation. Our technicians have experience working in historic homes while preserving their architectural integrity.</p>

          <p>The Charpentier District, named for the French word for "carpenter," showcases the woodworking skills of early Lake Charles craftsmen. These homes, many dating from the late 1800s to early 1900s, weren't designed with modern HVAC systems in mind—which creates unique challenges that we're equipped to solve.</p>

          <h2>HVAC Services for Historic Charpentier Homes</h2>

          <h2>Unique Challenges in Historic Homes</h2>
          <p>Charpentier District homes present specific HVAC challenges that require expertise:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>No Existing Ductwork:</strong> Many Victorian homes were built before central air—we offer ductless solutions</li>
            <li><strong>Plaster Walls:</strong> Requires careful installation techniques to avoid damage</li>
            <li><strong>High Ceilings:</strong> Creates larger volumes to cool and unique air distribution needs</li>
            <li><strong>Older Wiring:</strong> May require electrical upgrades for modern HVAC systems</li>
            <li><strong>Preservation Requirements:</strong> We work within historic district guidelines</li>
            <li><strong>Humidity Control:</strong> Older homes often have more air infiltration, requiring better humidity management</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Why Ductless Mini Splits Work Well in Historic Homes</h2>

            <li>No need to install ductwork through historic walls and ceilings</li>
            <li>Only requires a small hole for refrigerant lines</li>
            <li>Zone control lets you cool individual rooms as needed</li>
            <li>Highly efficient operation reduces energy costs</li>
            <li>Preserves the architectural integrity of your home</li>
            <li>Provides both heating and cooling</li>
          </ul>
