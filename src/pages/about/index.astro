          <p class="lead"><strong>Latour's Air Conditioning & Heating</strong> is a family-owned HVAC company proudly serving Lake Charles, Louisiana and the surrounding Southwest Louisiana communities. Since 2010, we've built our reputation on honest pricing, quality workmanship, and treating every customer like family.</p>

          <h2>Our Story</h2>
          <p>Latour's HVAC was founded with a simple mission: provide Lake Charles homeowners with HVAC service they can trust. After years of working for larger HVAC companies, we saw too many customers overcharged for unnecessary repairs or pressured into buying new systems they didn't need. We knew there had to be a better way.</p>

          <p>We started Latour's HVAC to offer something different—honest diagnostics, fair pricing, and repairs that actually fix the problem. Today, we're proud to be one of the most trusted HVAC contractors in Calcasieu Parish, serving thousands of satisfied customers across Lake Charles, Sulphur, Westlake, Moss Bluff, and beyond.</p>

          <h2>Our Values</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Honesty First:</strong> We'll tell you what's actually wrong with your system—not what makes us the most money. If a repair will fix it, we recommend the repair. Period.</li>
            <li><strong>Fair Pricing:</strong> Upfront quotes before we start work. No hidden fees, no surprise charges, no pressure tactics.</li>
            <li><strong>Quality Workmanship:</strong> Every job done right the first time. We stand behind our work with comprehensive warranties.</li>
            <li><strong>Respect for Your Home:</strong> Shoe covers, drop cloths, and thorough cleanup. We leave your home cleaner than we found it.</li>
            <li><strong>Community Commitment:</strong> We live here too. Lake Charles is our home, and we're invested in serving our neighbors well.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Why Choose Latour's HVAC?</h2>

          <h3>Licensed & Insured</h3>
          <p>We're fully licensed by the State of Louisiana and carry comprehensive liability and workers' compensation insurance. Your home and family are protected when you choose Latour's.</p>

          <h3>Experienced Technicians</h3>
          <p>Our technicians are factory-trained on all major HVAC brands including Carrier, Trane, Lennox, Goodman, Rheem, and more. We invest in ongoing training to stay current with the latest equipment and techniques.</p>

          <h3>24/7 Emergency Service</h3>
          <p>AC emergencies don't wait for business hours, and neither do we. Our emergency line is answered 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. When you call, a real person answers—not a machine.</p>

          <h3>Satisfaction Guaranteed</h3>
          <p>We're not satisfied until you're satisfied. If something isn't right, we'll make it right. That's our promise to every customer.</p>
