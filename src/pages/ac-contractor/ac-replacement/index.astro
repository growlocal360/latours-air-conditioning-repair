          <p class="lead">When your <strong>AC replacement in Lake Charles</strong> can't wait, Latour's HVAC delivers fast, professional service. We understand a broken air conditioner in Louisiana's heat is an emergency. Our team provides same-day assessments, honest recommendations, and quality replacement systems that will keep your family comfortable for years to come.</p>

          <p>Replacing an air conditioning system is a significant investment, but it doesn't have to be stressful. We guide you through every step—from choosing the right replacement unit to professional installation and post-installation support.</p>

          <h2>Signs You Need AC Replacement</h2>
          <p>Not sure if it's time to replace your AC? Here are the key warning signs:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Age:</strong> Your AC is 10-15+ years old. Most systems last 15-20 years with proper maintenance, but efficiency declines significantly after 10 years.</li>
            <li><strong>Frequent Repairs:</strong> You're calling for repairs multiple times per season, or repair costs are adding up.</li>
            <li><strong>Rising Energy Bills:</strong> Your electricity costs keep climbing even though your usage hasn't changed.</li>
            <li><strong>Uneven Cooling:</strong> Some rooms are comfortable while others are too hot or too cold.</li>
            <li><strong>R-22 Refrigerant:</strong> Your system uses R-22 (Freon), which is being phased out and increasingly expensive.</li>
            <li><strong>Strange Noises:</strong> Grinding, squealing, or banging sounds indicate serious mechanical problems.</li>
            <li><strong>Humidity Problems:</strong> Your home feels muggy even when the AC is running.</li>
            <li><strong>Major Component Failure:</strong> The compressor or condenser coil has failed—often more cost-effective to replace the entire system.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>The Repair vs. Replace Decision</h2>
          <p>We'll give you an honest assessment. Generally, consider replacement when:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Repair costs exceed 50% of replacement cost</li>
            <li>Your system is over 10 years old AND needs major repairs</li>
            <li>You're facing multiple expensive repairs in a short time</li>
            <li>Your system uses obsolete R-22 refrigerant</li>
            <li>Energy bills are significantly higher than neighbors with similar homes</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Sometimes repair is the right choice. We won't push replacement if a simple repair makes more sense for your situation and budget.</p>

          </ol>

          <h2>Benefits of AC Replacement</h2>
          <p>A new air conditioning system offers significant advantages:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Lower Energy Bills:</strong> Modern AC systems are 20-40% more efficient than units from 10-15 years ago.</li>
            <li><strong>Improved Comfort:</strong> Better humidity control, more even temperatures, and quieter operation.</li>
            <li><strong>Reliable Cooling:</strong> No more breakdowns on the hottest days of the year.</li>
            <li><strong>Warranty Protection:</strong> New equipment comes with manufacturer warranties for peace of mind.</li>
            <li><strong>Modern Features:</strong> Smart thermostat compatibility, variable-speed technology, and improved air filtration.</li>
            <li><strong>Environmentally Friendly:</strong> New systems use R-410A refrigerant, which doesn't deplete the ozone layer.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>AC Replacement Cost Factors</h2>
          <p>Several factors affect your replacement cost:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>System Size:</strong> Larger homes require larger, more expensive systems.</li>
            <li><strong>Efficiency Rating:</strong> Higher SEER ratings cost more upfront but save money on energy bills.</li>
            <li><strong>System Type:</strong> Standard AC, heat pump, or ductless systems have different costs.</li>
            <li><strong>Ductwork Condition:</strong> If your ducts need repair or modification, this adds to the cost.</li>
            <li><strong>Electrical Requirements:</strong> Older homes may need electrical panel upgrades.</li>
            <li><strong>Brand & Features:</strong> Premium brands and advanced features affect pricing.</li>
          </ul>
